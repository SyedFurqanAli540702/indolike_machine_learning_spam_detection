This project implements a machine learning-based system to classify SMS messages as spam or ham (non-spam). The system leverages natural language processing (NLP) techniques to extract features from text messages and applies classification algorithms to detect spam messages automatically.

KEY FEATURES:
Ham (Legitimate SMS)
Spam (Unwanted Promotional/Fraud Messages)
The dataset was collected from various public sources and is commonly used for research in spam detection.



Data Preprocessing: Cleans and tokenizes SMS text data to remove noise and irrelevant content.

Feature Extraction: Converts text messages into numerical features using techniques like TF-IDF and Bag of Words.

Spam Classification: Utilizes machine learning models such as Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, or Support Vector Machines (SVM) for message classification.
